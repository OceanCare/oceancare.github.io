  <p class="editable" style="text-align: justify;">The trauma of the ongoing pandemic and the utter helplessness in the face of it hit us home when we lost a friend, 32 year old Rishi Pathak who succumbed to Covid-19, last week.  In his memory, we have started an initiative to help provide commuting services, free of charge.</p>
  <p class="editable" style="text-align: justify;">Rishi was a kind soul who only brought joy to the lives he touched. We owe it to him and the countless others to do our utmost at this time in our lives</p>
